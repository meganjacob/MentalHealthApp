# Mental Health App

Welcome to Jane - Your AI Mental Health Support

Jane is not a therapist replacement but she is a resource that you can use whether you need accessible and free support or do not have access to therapy services.

This project was submitted to [LA Hacks 2024](https://devpost.com/software/jane-mental-health-chat-bot). I did not get to spend much time on it so I was not able to implement all of my ideas. Regardless, it was great to work with Gemini AI and get some web app development experience.

To run the application you will need to get your own Gemini API key and set that up in a .env file. Then run

```
npm start
```
